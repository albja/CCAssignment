    * No, it's impossible.
    * Proof: when we cut off the corners, we have 7 squares in first row and last row.
    *        Since each domino will take 2 squares, when we cover the first row, there will be
    *        one domino stretches into the second row. And when try to cover the second row,
    *        there will be another domino stretches to the third row. For each row, when we try to
     *       cover the row, there must be one domino stretches to the next row. Hence it is impossible
     *       to use 31 dominos to cover the entire board.

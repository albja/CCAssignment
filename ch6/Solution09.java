    * Locker k is left open if the number of its factor is odd(including 1 and itself). Only the perfect square
    * has odd number of factors, since the perfect square number n has square root of n as its factor, which
    * is only pairred with itself and gives an odd number of factors.
    * There are 10 perfect square numbers from 1 to 100, hence 10 lockers are open after the 100th pass in the hallway.
